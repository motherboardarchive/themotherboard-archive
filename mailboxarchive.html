I wish I could have told your dad to be nicer to you. and I wish I could have followed you into high school and become your best friend because I know we would have gotten along. I wish I could have protected you. from high school boys one in particular so we would have one last shared experience. I I know we would have been. good friends and I wish I could have had somebody like you around when I was going through my hardest time and we could have shared those things. And I love you."</p>
