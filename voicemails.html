Protection I guess I always wish I had that like movie brother s*** where it's like my brother is going to beat you up. But she had a good relationship with her brothers, but I don't know. I think she felt burdened by being a woman. And so she doesn't and like want men to be nice or some s*** like that. I don't know. She doesn't anticipate them to be nice or expect them to be nice. or expect anything of them so she just Goes belly up and I'm not like that at all. So I wish you would like that. Thank you.
